## Hi I´m Carlos 👋

### Frontend Developer focus on React.

I’m a **Frontend Developer focused on React**, passionate about building clean, scalable, and well-structured user interfaces.  
I work mainly with **modern React** (hooks, state management, data fetching, performance) and continuously build real-world projects to improve my skills.

I’m comfortable working independently, communicating clearly, and collaborating in async/remote environments.
